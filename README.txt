So, this is my current setup with Hyprland,
that's pretty much all I have to say

*in theory* running `install.sh` should do the trick
Though, it's made only to work in arch, so unless you're using 
an arch distro or arch itself, it won't work.

I haven't tried the install.sh in a clean install so,
if it doesn't work, do open an issue.
